## Project Requirements

### Content

Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make?
I'm a pretty visual person, so I tried not to spend too much time choosing colours and fonts, and get too caught up in the small details. I tried my best to trust my instincts and chose things I was aesthetically drawn to. I chose a picture taken in Hyde Park at the beginning of the year because it captured a nice memory, I used Chat GPT to help write my biography and I googled and copied and pasted to make the contact form. I used Formspree to make the form functional. I used a coding project I did for Shecodes.io last year and put in a picture I found on Google as a placeholder for the second project. I used icons for the external sites and added links.

- [ ] At least one profile picture
- [ ] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [ ] Functional Contact Form
- [ ] "Projects" section
- [ ] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

### Technical

Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from?
I started my project with designing a layout on Figma for both desktop and mobile. My initial goal was to get the HTML on the page and then decide on the design details. The main features of my first page (home page) include my profile picture, my bio and a functional contact form. The second page features my projects. I used the terminal to track my changes, but have had some issues with the main branch on Github, even after committing and pushing the changes.So my portfolio page is only coming up on the develop branch as a result. I will keep trying to correct it.

- [ ] At least 2 web pages.
- [ ] Version controlled with Git
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles.
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)

Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any.

- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
